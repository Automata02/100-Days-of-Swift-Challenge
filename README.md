✨100 Days of Swift Challenge✨</h1>
<br/>
This repository contains my attempt at the <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/">100 Days of Swift Challenge</a> completed over a span of few months (04/2022 - 07-2022) as a complete beginner to Swift and mobile app development in general.
<br/>
Whilst all of the projects do build in xcode and run on devices and simulator some of them are incomplete so they probably shouldn't be used as examplory attempts of completing the challenge. 😅
